##Fossil SCM與Stunnel 啟動
####步驟1. 執行fossil_repo目錄執行指令
<pre>fossil init 組別.fpssil</pre>
<a href="http://imgur.com/lxR6Cpe"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/lxR6Cpe.jpg" title="source: imgur.com" /></a>

<p>*帳號密碼記得儲存</p>


###步驟2. 更改Start.bat內容(在SciTE下更改)
<pre>
REM tiny2017 主要針對初學 Python3 與 C 學員所建立
REM 近端使用 fossil 管理資料版本, 並且定時轉為 git 格式後上傳到 github
@echo off
REM 設定 y 硬碟代號與 data 目錄對應
set Disk=y
subst %Disk%: "data"
REM 設定 leo 相關對應 Home 位置
set HomePath=%Disk%:\home
set HomeDrive=%Disk%:\home
set Home=%Disk%:\home
REM 將系統 Python 程式的 io 設為 utf-8
set PYTHONIOENCODING="utf-8"
REM 將後續的指令執行, 以 %Disk% 為主
%Disk%:
REM 設定 PYTHONPATH
set PYTHONPATH=%Disk%:\python-3.5.3-embed-amd64
REM 設定 Leo 所用的編輯器
set LEO_EDITOR=%Disk%:\wscite\SciTE.exe
REM for fossil https 連線設定
set HTTPS=on
REM 指令搜尋路徑設定
set path1=%PATH%;%Disk%:;%Disk%:\python-3.5.3-embed-amd64;%Disk%:\git\bin;%Disk%:\stunnel\bin;%Disk%:\sqlite-tools;%Disk%:\python-3.5.3-embed-amd64\Scripts;%Disk%:\portablegit\bin;
set path2=c:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v3.5;%Disk%:\python-3.5.3-embed-amd64\Lib\site-packages;
path=%path%;%path1%;%path2%
start /MIN %Disk%:\wscite\SciTE.exe
start /MIN cmd.exe
start /MIN cmd.exe
start /MIN cmd.exe
REM 啟動 Leo 編輯器
REM %Disk%:\Miniconda3\python.exe %Disk%:\apps\launchLeo.py
REM 啟動 stunnel
start /MIN fossil.exe server -P 127.0.0.1:8080 %Disk%:\tmp\fossil_repo\2017springcd_hw.fpssil
REM 取得電腦 IP, 然後設定 %Disk%:/stunnel/config/stunnel.conf
for /f "delims=[] tokens=2" %%a in ('ping -4 -n 1 %ComputerName% ^| findstr [') do set NetworkIP=%%a
REM echo Network IP: %NetworkIP%
REM Saved in %Disk%:\stunnel\config\stunnel.conf
@echo off
REM 建立 stunnel.conf
@echo [https] > %Disk%:\stunnel\config\stunnel.conf
REM 附加資料
@echo accept = %NetworkIP%:443 >> %Disk%:\stunnel\config\stunnel.conf
@echo connect = 127.0.0.1:8080 >> %Disk%:\stunnel\config\stunnel.conf
@echo TIMEOUTclose = 0 >> %Disk%:\stunnel\config\stunnel.conf
@echo cert = %Disk%:\stunnel\config\localhost.crt >> %Disk%:\stunnel\config\stunnel.conf
@echo key = %Disk%:\stunnel\config\localhost.key >> %Disk%:\stunnel\config\stunnel.conf
REM 啟動 stunnel
start /MIN stunnel.exe
Exit
</pre>
<p>*記得要儲存</p>

####步驟3. 執行查詢IP指令(如有使用proxy，記得先關閉)
<pre>ipconfig /all</pre>
<a href="http://imgur.com/uKh1Dq3"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/uKh1Dq3.png" title="source: imgur.com" /></a>

####步驟4. 將查詢到的IPv4
<pre>在網頁上輸入 https://IP位址 </pre>

####完成

####可在網頁中進入設定更改成自己小組的名字

##hyperworks翻譯
###hyperworks1
In the 2017 release, we followed our vision and implement a lot more features, delivering more technology for your HyperWorks units investment.
In our continuous development, we focused, as always, on simulation-driven innovation, adding more optimization technology. 
We added more physics simulation to the software, and we improved our parallel performance on high performance computers. 
OptiStruct, which is our implicit code, adds a lot of development in the nonlinear implicit area, but also in the optimization technology. 
RADIOSS, we see a lot of development in new materials and material modeling. 
You probably know that we did the acquisition of MDS a couple of years back, and we have now MDS integrated with RSDIOSS, and are doing application there. MotionSolve is based on a very unique formulation that this different from other multibody dynamics code, and the MotionSolve formulation lends itself very well to optimization implementation. So the team has worked really hard on contact formulations, got very robust. It's very cool which kind of problems can solve with contact modelling.
So this is along the structural solvers side on AcuSolve side we actually added the complete portfolio of turbulence and transition models that really helps us to solve problems in wind turbines and automotive industry much more accurately, and it’s a big asset of physics simulation.
And then our electromagnetic suite has actually grown last year through the acquisition of Flux, from the CEDRAT company.
As well as the acquisition of WinProp, from AWE.
So now we have a complete frequency spectrum from low frequency electromagnetics the high frequency electromagnetics which is powered by FEKO.
We now have a complete portfolio of physics modeling available for our customers, and it’s all linked through optimization.
 
###hyperworks3
In OptiStruct, one of our focus areas is nonlinear large deformation analysis 
And in 2017 we added nonlinear transient analysis
The main purpose was to couple AcuSolve to do fluid-structure interaction
But also one development that happened during the last year
Came out piece-wise in different point releases
And is now really mature
And 2017 is our contact analysis
So we have different ways of defining large sliding contact and things like that
The fast contact analysis for small deformation is blazing fast
It’s a very simple idea that makes the solution very fast, and that adds OptiStruct as really a leading nonlinear 
Our two major optimization packages are OptiStruct for structural optimization, there’s a huge multidisciplinary component, too
And Hyperstudy for general optimization wrap around multidisciplinary optimization
[For] OptiStruct we spend a lot of time continuing the development for optimization
And we have now Failsafe topology optimization
We kept on working on the manufacturing solution to do lattice optimization
For the multi-model optimization it’s really maturing and we find more and more applications where that helps 
Our goal is actually to include all the physics in the optimizations
So the team right now is working on optimization for nonlinear problems and so on
And then Hyperstudy, on the other hand, is going through a new transformation of the user the user experience was changed a few years back, but we are now trying to  make it much more easy to use by hiding a lot of the advanced functionalities to the regular users
And depending on the level of expertise or depending on the job that the user has to do, they can customize the userience
We adds a few new connections
One of them is a Flux connection
Flux is an electromagnetics code that we just acquired for low frequency electromagnetics, so we can all take a Flux database and put it into Hyperstudy into the study with that

##心得
<p> 1.學習如何使用Fossil SCM </p>
<p> 2.目前Stunnel 啟動不能再proxy下進入網頁 </p>
<p> 3.英文翻譯學習 </p>
